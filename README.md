# 🐔 MyChickensRecordSystem — Chicken-UI PID

## Overview

**Chicken-UI PID** is a command-line interface (CLI) application built in Python to help a local chicken breeder manage their chicken records. This is a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** designed to demonstrate how a paper-based system can be replaced with a simple, local digital solution.

The app supports:

- Viewing a list of chickens  
- Adding new chicken records  
- Updating existing chicken names  
- Deleting chicken records  
- Exiting the application  

All data is stored in memory using a Python list. The current version does **not** persist data after exiting, but enhancements like CSV file storage are planned.
